**Computational detection and statistical analysis of inter-word character patterns in Biblical Hebrew.**

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for identifying *mesologia* (singular: *mesologion*) — semantically significant patterns formed by characters split across word boundaries in ancient Hebrew texts written in *scriptio continua* (continuous script without spaces).

**Key Finding:** The tetragrammaton (יהוה, YHWH) appears 68 times with the final letters of one word forming יה and the first letters of the following word forming וה. This pattern occurs significantly more frequently than expected by chance (p < 0.0001) and shows structural elaboration in key biblical passages.

## What is a Mesologion?

A **mesologion** (from Greek μέσο + λόγιον, "between-word") is an inter-word pattern where characters at word boundaries form meaningful sequences that are invisible in modern translations but visible in ancient continuous Hebrew script.

Example from Song of Songs 2:13:
```
Hebrew (modern):  פַּגֶּ֙יהָ֙  וְהַגְּפָנִים֙
Consonantal:      פגיה   והגפנים
Translation:      her figs  and-the-vines

Mesologion:       פגיה והגפנים
                    ^^ ^^
                    יה וה  = יהוה (YHWH)
```

## Key Results

### Statistical Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total biblical words analyzed | 426,590 |
| Words ending with יה | 3,822 (0.896%) |
| Words beginning with וה | 4,577 (1.073%) |
| Expected adjacent occurrences | 41.0 |
| **Observed adjacent occurrences** | **68** |
| **Observed/Expected ratio** | **1.66** |
| **P-value (Poisson tail)** | **0.000071** |

### Notable Instances

1. **Song of Songs 2:13** - Structurally elaborate with 26 words before and 26 words after the mesologion (26 = gematria value of YHWH)

2. **Genesis 22:2** - The mesologion occurs between "Moriah" and "offer him" in a verse that differs by one letter from the Samaritan Pentateuch, suggesting redactional intention

3. **Proverbs 1:6 & 29:26** - The only two instances of שלום (shalom) as a mesologion both frame Solomon's wisdom in Proverbs

### Control Word Comparison

| Word           | Expected | Observed | Ratio | P-value      | Significant? |
|----------------|----------|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **יהוה (YHWH)**| 41.0     | 68       | 1.66  | **0.000071** | ✓ **Yes** |
| שלום (shalom)  | 0.73     | 2        | 2.74  | 0.166        | No        |
| תורה (torah)   | 0.48     | 0        | 0.00  | 0.620        | No        |
| ברית (covenant)| 2.95     | 1        | 0.34  | 0.950        | No        |
| יעקב (jacob)   | 1.82     | 0        | 0.00  | 0.838        | No        |

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Text-Fabric 12.0+
- BHSA (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia Amstelodamensis) database

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/guslott/mesologia.git
cd mesologia

# Install dependencies
pip install text-fabric

# Clone BHSA database (requires ~500MB)
git clone https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa.git
```

## Usage

### Basic Search

Search for the tetragrammaton pattern:

```bash
python yhwh_between_search.py
```

### Statistical Analysis

Generate statistical validation:

```bash
python yhwh_between_stats.py
```

### Custom Pattern Search

Edit the configuration in the script:

```python
# In yhwh_between_search.py
WORD_TO_SEARCH = "יהוה"  # Change to search for different patterns
FIRST_WORD_SUFFIX = WORD_TO_SEARCH[:2]
SECOND_WORD_PREFIX = WORD_TO_SEARCH[2:]
```

### Example: Search for Shalom

```python
WORD_TO_SEARCH = "שלומ"  # Note: you may use final forms
```

## Methodology

### Pattern Detection Algorithm

1. **Normalization**: Strip vowel points and cantillation marks, normalize final letter forms
2. **Suffix Detection**: Identify all words ending with target suffix (יה)
3. **Prefix Matching**: Check if following word(s) begin with target prefix (וה)
4. **Multi-word Spans**: Handle cases where prefix spans multiple words
5. **Context Extraction**: Capture ±3 words for verification

### Statistical Framework

**Null Hypothesis**: Inter-word patterns occur at frequency predicted by random word ordering

**Model**: Poisson distribution with λ = (N-1) × P(suffix) × P(prefix)

**Validation**: 
- Control words testing
- Genre distribution analysis
- Manuscript evidence (Aleppo Codex)
- Textual variant comparison (Masoretic vs. Samaritan)

TODO: See [docs/statistical_framework.md](docs/statistical_framework.md) for details.

## Limitations

### Known Issues

1. **Grammatical Constraints**: יה and וה are common morphological elements; some instances may be grammatically driven rather than intentional

2. **Dating Uncertainty**: Cannot definitively date when patterns were introduced (likely post-exilic redaction, but uncertain)

3. **Independence Assumption**: Poisson model assumes word independence, but Hebrew syntax is not fully random

4. **Sample Size**: 68 instances is statistically significant but relatively small

### What This Study Does NOT Claim

- That every instance was intentional
- That ancient authors (vs. later redactors) created all patterns
- That medieval manuscript evidence proves original authorial intent
- That statistical patterns fully overcome grammatical explanations

See [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md) for full discussion.

## Case Studies

### Song of Songs 2:13

**Unique Features:**
- פגיה is a *hapax legomenon* (appears nowhere else in the Bible)
- והגפנים is the ONLY instance of וה- prefix in Song of Songs
- 26 words before + 26 words after the word פגיה which anchors the mesologion
- Appears on the final extant page of the Aleppo Codex with scribal marking
- תואבצב (2:7, 3:5) is present but with no reference to God, a rarety

TODO: [Full analysis](results/song_of_songs_analysis.md)

### Genesis 22:2

**Textual Variant:**
- Masoretic Text: המריה (ha-Moriah) → creates mesologion
- Samaritan Pentateuch: המוראה (ha-Moreh) → no mesologion
- Single letter difference (י vs. א)

**Historical Context:**
- Genesis 22:2 is ground zero for Jerusalem vs. Gerizim dispute
- Moriah = Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 3:1)
- Moreh = Shechem (Genesis 12:6)
- Suggests intentional redactional choice

TODO: [Full analysis](results/genesis_22_analysis.md)

### שולמ Framing Proverbs (1:6, 29:26)

**Unique Features:**
- Feature is very low sample count, so statistical argument is suspect
- Frames the solomonic proverbs perfectly at the opening and conclusion
- Solomon's name derives from this word

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this like "Bible codes"?**  
A: No. Bible codes were debunked because they used post-hoc pattern mining without controls. We test a specific hypothesis with statistical validation and control words.

**Q: Could this just be Hebrew grammar?**  
A: Partially yes. Some instances are likely grammatical. But key instances show structural elaboration, manuscript evidence, and textual variants suggesting intentionality beyond grammar.

**Q: Why should I trust this?**  
A: The code is open source. The data is public. The methods are documented. Run it yourself and verify.

**Q: What's the significance for biblical interpretation?**  
A: This suggests sophisticated redactional techniques in the post-exilic period and provides new evidence for understanding canonization processes, particularly for enigmatic books like Song of Songs.

**Q: Has this been peer reviewed?**  
A: Currently under review at *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*. This repository provides transparency during the review process.
